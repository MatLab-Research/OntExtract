# Shared Services Requirements
# Core dependencies for embedding, ontology, LLM, and file processing services
#
# Notes:
# - Flask and related web stack packages are intentionally omitted here to avoid
#   version conflicts. They are provided by the main application requirements
#   (see requirements.txt).
# - To prevent downgrades, any packages that are also specified in the main app
#   with higher versions have been removed here so they inherit the app's version.
