# === Integration with PROV-O ===
# Note: PROV-O classes and properties are imported, not redefined
# Semantic change events can be linked to PROV-O provenance:
# - prov:wasAttributedTo -> links event to researcher who identified it
# - prov:wasGeneratedBy -> links event to annotation activity
# - prov:wasDerivedFrom -> links event to source document analysis
# - prov:used -> links annotation activity to source documents

# === Annotation Guidelines (as OWL annotations) ===

sco: rdfs:seeAlso <https://github.com/MatLab-Research/OntExtract/docs/semantic-change-annotation-guidelines> ;
    rdfs:comment """
    Annotation Guidelines:

    1. Event Type Selection:
       - InflectionPoint: Use when change occurs rapidly (< 5 years typically)
       - StablePolysemy: Use when multiple meanings coexist without conflict
       - DomainNetwork: Use when term develops field-specific semantic cluster
       - ConceptualBridge: Use for works that explicitly connect disciplines
       - SemanticDrift: Use for gradual change over extended period (> 10 years)
       - Emergence: Use when entirely new meaning appears
       - Decline: Use when existing meaning becomes obsolete

    2. Evidence Requirements:
       - Minimum: 2 documents from different time periods
       - Preferred: Explicit discussion of term usage in scholarly work
       - Ideal: Quantitative frequency data + qualitative analysis

    3. Confidence Scores:
       - 0.9-1.0: Strong textual evidence, clear temporal boundaries
       - 0.7-0.9: Good evidence, approximate temporal boundaries
       - 0.5-0.7: Suggestive evidence, uncertain boundaries
       - < 0.5: Speculative, requires further investigation

    4. Temporal Precision:
       - Use OWL-Time intervals when possible
       - For approximate dating, use decade-level granularity
       - Document uncertainty in description field
