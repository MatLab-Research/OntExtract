# Academic Writing Style Checklist

Quick reference for OntExtract documentation writers.

---

## Before You Write

**Remember:** Maintain neutral academic tone. Avoid marketing language.

**Target Audience:** Digital humanities researchers with NLP knowledge, minimal coding experience.

---

## The 7 Rules

### 1. No Em Dashes or Colons in Body Text

Use periods. Write separate sentences.

**Wrong:**
```
The system provides three capabilities: extraction, analysis, and tracking.
OntExtract offers features—all designed for researchers.
```

**Right:**
```
The system provides three capabilities. These are extraction, analysis, and tracking.
OntExtract offers features designed for researchers.
```

---

### 2. No Possessive Forms for Inanimate Objects

**Exception:** People's names ARE possessive (McLaren's work, Davis's approach)

**Wrong:**
```
The system's architecture...
The timeline's display...
The ontology's validation...
```

**Right:**
```
The architecture of the system...
The timeline display...
Ontology validation...
```

---

### 3. Main Clause First

Avoid front-loaded subordinate clauses.

**Wrong:**
```
By analyzing metadata, the system determines strategies.
When creating experiments, users select terms.
```

**Right:**
```
The system determines strategies by analyzing metadata.
Users select terms when creating experiments.
```

---

### 4. No -ing Starts

Don't start sentences with present participial phrases.

**Wrong:**
```
Using the timeline view, researchers identify events.
Selecting an event type displays the definition.
Building on prior work, OntExtract implements processing.
```

**Right:**
```
Researchers identify events through the timeline view.
The system displays the definition when users select an event type.
OntExtract implements processing based on prior work.
```

---

### 5. No Overused Adjectives

**NEVER USE:**
- seamless
- nuanced
- robust
- intriguing
- comprehensive
- systematic

**Wrong:**
```
OntExtract provides a comprehensive solution.
The system offers a robust framework.
Users perform nuanced analysis.
The interface provides seamless integration.
```

**Right:**
```
OntExtract provides temporal analysis features.
The system offers a framework for processing.
Users analyze semantic change across periods.
The interface integrates with dictionary services.
```

---

### 6. No Marketing Language

**NEVER USE:**
- powerful
- cutting-edge
- state-of-the-art
- intuitive
- effortlessly
- deliver
- enable/empower
- leverage
- unlock
- streamline
- optimize
- innovative
- groundbreaking
- revolutionary
- game-changing

**Wrong:**
```
Powerful LLM orchestration seamlessly integrates cutting-edge tools.
The intuitive interface empowers users to effortlessly analyze documents.
Leverage state-of-the-art models to unlock insights.
```

**Right:**
```
LLM orchestration suggests tool configurations for documents.
The interface allows users to analyze documents.
The system uses language models to generate insights.
```

---

### 7. Direct Affirmative Statements

State what the system does. Avoid "rather than," "instead of," "not X but Y."

**Wrong:**
```
Rather than requiring manual configuration, the system suggests tools.
Instead of using one model, OntExtract applies multiple models.
The workflow is not automated but includes human review.
```

**Right:**
```
The system suggests tools for each document.
OntExtract applies period-specific embedding models.
The workflow includes human review at the strategy stage.
```

**Exception (when contrast is essential):**
```
Documents are sources rather than references when they contain primary content.
```

---

## Positive Practices

### Active Voice

**Use:**
```
The system generates strategies.
Users select event types.
```

**Avoid:**
```
Strategies are generated by the system.
Event types are selected.
```

---

### Present Tense

**Use:**
```
The system creates periods from document dates.
The timeline displays events.
```

**Avoid:**
```
The system will create periods...
The timeline will display...
```

---

### Specific, Concrete Language

**Vague:**
```
The system efficiently processes documents.
OntExtract provides advanced features.
```

**Specific:**
```
The system processes documents in parallel using 8 NLP tools.
OntExtract provides temporal period definition, semantic event annotation, and provenance tracking.
```

## Vocabulary Substitutions

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| powerful | (describe specific capabilities) |
| cutting-edge | recent, current |
| state-of-the-art | (describe actual methods) |
| intuitive | (describe interface elements) |
| effortlessly | (omit or describe process) |
| deliver | provide, generate, produce |
| enable | allow, support |
| leverage | use, apply |
| solution | system, platform, tool |
| innovative | (describe novel aspects) |
| streamline | simplify, automate |
| optimize | improve, configure |

---

## Page-Specific Guidelines

### Getting Started Pages

**Focus:** Clear procedural steps
**Avoid:** Enthusiasm about how "easy" things are

**Wrong:**
```
Getting started is easy! Simply follow these steps to unlock temporal analysis.
```

**Right:**
```
This guide covers installation and configuration. You will create a user account and verify connectivity.
```

---

### Feature Documentation

**Focus:** What the feature does and when to use it
**Avoid:** Claims about features being "best" or "advanced"

**Wrong:**
```
The advanced timeline visualization offers an intuitive interface for exploring complex relationships.
```

**Right:**
```
The timeline view displays semantic change events, periods, and documents chronologically. Users can view definitions, citations, and period boundaries.
```

---

### Troubleshooting

**Focus:** Symptoms, causes, solutions
**Avoid:** Apologetic language or frustration

**Wrong:**
```
Don't worry if you encounter this error—it's easily fixed!
```

**Right:**
```
This error occurs when the database connection fails. Verify PostgreSQL is running and connection parameters are correct.
```

---

## Self-Check Questions

Before submitting documentation, ask:

1. Did I use any em dashes or colons in body text?
2. Did I write "the system's" or other possessives for objects?
3. Do any sentences start with subordinate clauses?
4. Do any sentences start with -ing words?
5. Did I use seamless, robust, nuanced, comprehensive, systematic, or intriguing?
6. Did I use powerful, cutting-edge, intuitive, or other marketing words?
7. Did I use "rather than" or "instead of" unnecessarily?
8. Is everything in active voice and present tense?
9. Are my descriptions specific and concrete?
10. Does the tone feel neutral and academic?

**If you answered "yes" to questions 1-7, revise those sections.**

**If you answered "no" to questions 8-10, revise for clarity and tone.**

## Example Transformation

### Before (Marketing Tone)

```

providing researchers with a comprehensive and robust framework for nuanced analysis.
By leveraging state-of-the-art language models, the system delivers intuitive
recommendations—enabling users to effortlessly process complex historical documents.
Rather than requiring manual configuration, the platform empowers researchers to unlock
insights through an innovative human-in-the-loop workflow.
```

**Violations:**
- Em dash
- Possessive (OntExtract's)
- Front-loaded clause (By leveraging...)
- Overused adjectives (comprehensive, robust, nuanced)
- Marketing language (powerful, seamless, cutting-edge, state-of-the-art, intuitive, effortlessly, innovative)
- Negative construction (Rather than requiring...)
- Marketing verbs (deliver, enable, empower, unlock, leverage)

### After (Academic Tone)

```
OntExtract uses LLM orchestration to suggest NLP tool configurations for document
processing. The system analyzes document characteristics and research goals, then
recommends processing strategies for user review. Researchers approve or modify
these recommendations before the system executes the selected tools across the
document collection. The workflow includes human verification at each stage to
ensure alignment with research objectives.
```

**Improvements:**
- No punctuation violations
- No possessives for inanimate objects
- Main clauses first
- No -ing starts
- No overused adjectives
- No marketing language
- Direct affirmative statements
- Active voice, present tense
- Specific, concrete descriptions
