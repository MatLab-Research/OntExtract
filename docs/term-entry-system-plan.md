# Term Entry System Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implementation of a term-centric experimental framework for tracking semantic change over time, based on the research design in `researchDesign_Choi.pdf`. Terms serve as "anchor concepts" with full PROV-O provenance tracking and temporal metadata.

## Research Framework Context

### Core Concept: Context Anchor Definition
- **Seed Terms**: Curated from dictionary sources with documented historical significance
- **Context Anchor**: Semantic neighborhood of a seed term fixed to specific meaning at specific time
- **Temporal Drift**: Tracked through neighborhood overlap, positional change, similarity reduction
- **Fuzziness Score**: Degree of membership retention in original semantic category (0-1 scale)
- **Uncertainty Handling**: Explicit modeling with provisional/contested classifications

### PROV-O Integration Model
From the research framework, each term version represents:
- **prov:Entity**: Different temporal versions of term meanings
- **prov:Activity**: Semantic drift detection between time periods  
- **prov:Agent**: Detection algorithms (HistBERT, etc.) or human curators
- **Provenance Chain**: Full audit trail from corpus to semantic analysis

## Proposed Term Metadata Schema

Based on the research framework and PROV-O example, each term entry should capture:

### Core Term Information
```json
{
  "term_id": "uuid",
  "term_text": "cloud",
  "entry_date": "2025-08-24T10:30:00Z",
  "status": "active|provisional|deprecated",
  "created_by": "user_id"
}
```

### Temporal Versions (prov:Entity)
```json
{
  "version_id": "uuid",
  "term_id": "parent_term_uuid", 
  "temporal_period": "2000",
  "meaning_description": "meteorological phenomenon",
  "context_anchor": ["sky", "rain", "weather", "cumulus"],
  "fuzziness_score": 0.95,
  "confidence_level": "high|medium|low",
  "corpus_source": "COHA|Google_Books|Custom",
  "generated_at_time": "2000"^^xsd:gYear,
  "was_derived_from": "parent_version_uuid|corpus_source"
}
```

### Semantic Drift Activities (prov:Activity)
```json
{
  "activity_id": "uuid",
  "activity_type": "semantic_drift_detection",
  "start_period": "2000",
  "end_period": "2010", 
  "used_entity": "term_2000_version_uuid",
  "generated_entity": "term_2010_version_uuid",
  "was_associated_with": "HistBERT_Model|human_curator",
  "drift_metrics": {
    "neighborhood_overlap": 0.3,
    "positional_change": 0.7,
    "similarity_reduction": 0.6
  },
  "ended_at_time": "2010"^^xsd:gYear
}
```

### Detection Agents (prov:Agent)
```json
{
  "agent_id": "uuid",
  "agent_type": "SoftwareAgent|Person",
  "name": "HistBERT Temporal Embedding Alignment",
  "description": "Algorithm for semantic drift detection",
  "version": "1.0"
}
```

## Implementation Decisions ✅

Based on user requirements, the following decisions have been made:

### Navigation & User Flow
1. **Dashboard Integration**: ✅ "Add Term" will be the prominent feature on dashboard, replacing upload buttons priority
2. **Term Discovery**: ✅ Alphabetical index initially, categories and search to be added later  
3. **Multi-step Entry**: ✅ Wizard mode showing one part of the interface at a time

### Term Version Management
4. **Initial Entry**: ✅ Create first temporal version immediately, capture term creation as temporal event
5. **Version Creation**: ✅ Manual entry for now, import from analysis capabilities added later
6. **Context Anchors**: ✅ Searchable/autocomplete from existing terms

### PROV-O Integration Approach
7. **OntServe Connection**: ✅ Yes, but OntServe ontology serving incomplete - may need to enhance OntServe first
8. **Provenance Depth**: ✅ Capture automatically where possible, meaningful manual entries with UI helpers
9. **Corpus Integration**: ✅ Separate process for term embeddings/analysis, distinct from document processing

### Data Storage & Analysis  
10. **Database Schema**: ✅ Create separate term-focused tables in PostgreSQL
11. **Fuzziness Calculation**: ✅ Automatic calculation with manual adjustment tracking (creates audit record)
12. **Priority**: ✅ Data entry first, visualization features later

## Implementation Phases (Updated)

### Term Entry Interface Updated to Match Choi Research Framework

Based on analysis of `docs/researchDesign_Choi.pdf` and examination of the current implementation, the term entry system has been completely redesigned to align with the research methodology:

#### 🔧 **Phase 1 Completed: Core Framework Alignment**

**✅ Fuzziness Score Removed from Initial Entry**
- **Research Requirement**: "calculated from the proportion of the term's original neighbors that continue to exhibit high similarity"
- **Implementation**: Removed manual entry field, added informational note about automatic calculation
- **Result**: Aligns with research methodology where fuzziness is computed, not entered

**✅ Temporal Period System Enhanced**  
- **Research Requirement**: "reference period is selected based on its historical and analytical relevance"
- **Implementation**: Adopted sophisticated period selection from experiments interface
- **Options Available**:
  - Single Year: For precise historical anchoring (e.g., 2000)
  - Year Range: For period-based analysis (e.g., 1990-2020)  
  - Named Period: For descriptive periods (e.g., "Victorian Era", "Early 20th Century")
- **Default**: 2000 (aligns with experiments default)

**✅ Context Anchoring Method Selection**
- **Research Requirement**: "semantic neighborhood of a seed term fixed to a specific meaning at a specific point in time"
- **Implementation**: Four anchoring methods following research best practices:
  1. **Manual Entry**: Direct term input (existing functionality preserved)
  2. **Reference Document**: Anchor to existing references with full citation (following COHA corpus pattern from examplePROVO.txt)
  3. **OED Entry**: Integration with existing OED functionality for authoritative definitions
  4. **Ontology**: OntServe integration for formal concept anchoring

#### 📋 **Implementation Details**

**Dictionary Integration Strategy** ✅ PLANNED
