# Archived Templates

This directory contains old/unused templates that have been replaced but are kept for reference.

## Why Archive?

These templates are not actively used by any routes but contain code that might be useful for reference or might be needed in the future.

## Files

- `document_detail.html` - Old document detail template, replaced by `document_detail_simplified.html`
  - Archived: January 2025
  - Reason: Route now uses `document_detail_simplified.html` (text_input.py:325)
  - Note: Contains more complex version navigation that was simplified in the newer template

- `upload.html` - Old upload form template, replaced by `upload_enhanced.html`
  - Archived: January 2025
  - Reason: Route now uses `upload_enhanced.html` with automatic metadata extraction
  - Note: Contains simpler upload form without automatic PDF analysis features
