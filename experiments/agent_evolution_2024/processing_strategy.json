  "strategy_reasoning": "This strategy prioritizes semantic evolution analysis of 'agent' across the century-long timeline. For all documents, I recommend: (1) segment_paragraph to create manageable chunks for analysis, (2) extract_entities_spacy to identify what concepts, organizations, and people co-occur with 'agent' in each domain/era, and (3) extract_definitions to capture explicit definitions of 'agent' as they evolve from legal to philosophical to computational contexts. For the two most comprehensive documents (Wooldridge & Jennings 1995 and OED 2024), I add extract_temporal to track chronological references and historical development patterns. The Black's Law Dictionary entries (1910, 2019, 2024) will reveal legal evolution; Anscombe (1957) captures the philosophical bridge; Wooldridge & Jennings (1995) marks the AI emergence; Russell & Norvig (2020) shows modern AI consolidation; and the OED (2024) synthesizes all domains. This approach will enable comparison of definitional shifts, contextual associations, and temporal markers across the legal\u2192philosophical\u2192computational trajectory.",
