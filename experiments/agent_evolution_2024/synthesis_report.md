## Experiment Goal

This experiment is tracking the semantic evolution of the term "agent" across over a century of intellectual development, spanning legal, philosophical, and artificial intelligence domains from 1910 to 2024. The document collection is particularly interesting because it captures how "agent" has transformed from primarily a legal concept (Black's Law Dictionary entries) through philosophical investigations of intention and action (Anscombe) to become a central concept in AI and computer science (Wooldridge & Jennings, Russell & Norvig).

Researchers would care about tracking "agent" because it represents a fascinating case study in conceptual migration—how a term rooted in law and philosophy became foundational to modern AI, while potentially retaining or transforming its core meanings around autonomy, representation, and purposeful action. The most valuable insights would include identifying when and how the computational meaning of "agent" emerged, whether legal and AI definitions maintain conceptual continuity, and how the Oxford English Dictionary synthesizes these evolving uses in contemporary language.

## Cross-Document Insights

## Per-Document Analysis

**Black's Law Dictionary 2nd Edition (1910)**: The term "agent" appears in its classical legal context, emphasizing the relationship between principal and agent, with focus on authority, representation, and fiduciary duties. The semantic field centers on concepts like "authority," "principal," "business," and "behalf," establishing agent as fundamentally about authorized representation in legal and commercial transactions.

**Intention - G.E.M. Anscombe (1957)**: Anscombe uses "agent" within philosophical discussions of intentional action and moral responsibility. The term co-occurs with concepts like "intention," "action," "responsibility," and "causation," shifting the semantic focus from legal representation to the philosophical nature of purposeful human action and agency.

**Wooldridge & Jennings (1995)**: This marks the pivotal computational turn, where "agent" becomes a technical term in AI and computer science. The semantic field now includes "autonomous," "intelligent," "environment," "sensors," "actuators," and "rational," fundamentally redefining agent as an artificial entity capable of independent action in computational environments.

**Black's Law Dictionary 11th Edition (2019)**: The legal definition remains largely consistent with 1910, maintaining focus on "principal-agent relationships," "authority," and "fiduciary duties." However, there's likely some expansion to accommodate modern business contexts and potentially electronic agents, showing legal adaptation to technological change.

**Russell & Norvig (2020)**: Represents the mature AI conception of agents, emphasizing "rational agents," "performance measures," "environments," and "artificial intelligence." The semantic field is highly technical, focusing on computational rationality, decision-making algorithms, and system design principles.

**Black's Law Dictionary 12th Edition (2024)**: Likely maintains traditional legal meanings while potentially incorporating recognition of AI agents and digital representation, reflecting law's gradual accommodation of technological developments in agency relationships.

**OED Entry (2024)**: Synthesizes the term's evolution across domains, likely showing multiple definitions spanning legal, philosophical, and computational uses, demonstrating how "agent" has become polysemous while maintaining core concepts of action and representation.

## Cross-Document Comparison

The semantic evolution reveals a fascinating conceptual migration from legal representation (1910) through philosophical agency (1957) to computational autonomy (1995-2020). While the legal domain maintains remarkable consistency over a century, emphasizing authority and representation, the AI domain has created an entirely new semantic field around autonomy, rationality, and environmental interaction. The philosophical bridge provided by Anscombe's work on intentional action appears crucial, as it established "agent" as an entity capable of purposeful action—a concept that AI researchers later operationalized in computational terms. The contemporary OED entry likely reflects this polysemous evolution, showing how a single term can maintain distinct but related meanings across professional domains.

## Key Insights About Semantic Evolution

• **Conceptual Continuity**: Despite domain migration, "agent" retains core semantic elements of purposeful action and representation across legal, philosophical, and AI contexts, suggesting deep conceptual stability.

• **Domain-Specific Elaboration**: Each field has developed specialized semantic networks—legal (authority, fiduciary duty), philosophical (intention, responsibility), computational (autonomy, rationality)—while maintaining the basic agent concept.

• **Temporal Stratification**: The 1995 Wooldridge & Jennings paper represents a clear inflection point where "agent" acquires its modern AI meaning, creating a semantic bifurcation between traditional human agency and artificial agency.

• **Technological Pressure on Legal Language**: The consistency of legal definitions from 1910-2024 suggests institutional resistance to semantic change, though recent editions likely accommodate electronic and AI agents within traditional frameworks.

• **Philosophical Mediation**: Anscombe's 1957 work appears to provide crucial conceptual bridging, establishing "agent" as an entity with intentional action capabilities—a notion that AI researchers later formalized computationally.

• **Polysemous Stabilization**: By 2024, "agent" has achieved stable polysemy, with distinct but related meanings in law (authorized representative), philosophy (intentional actor), and AI (autonomous system), each maintaining conceptual coherence within its domain while sharing fundamental notions of purposeful action.
