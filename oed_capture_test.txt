https://www.oed.com/dictionary/ontology_n?tab=meaning_and_use 3/5Historical frequency series are derived from Google Books Ngrams (version 2), a data set based on the Google
Books corpus of several million books printed in English between 1500 and 2010.
The overall frequency for a given word is calculated by summing frequencies for the main form of the word,
any plural or inected forms, and any major spelling variations.
For sets of homographs (distinct entries that share the same word-form, e.g. mole, n.¹, mole, n.², mole, n.³,
etc.), we have estimated the frequency of each homograph entry as a fraction of the total Ngrams frequency
for the word-form. This may result in inaccuracies.
Smoothing has been applied to series for lower-frequency words, using a moving-average algorithm. This
reduces short-term uctuations, which may be produced by variability in the content of the Google Books
corpus.
Frequency of ontology, n., 2017–2023
* Occurrences per million words in written English
Modern frequency series are derived from a corpus of 20 billion words, covering the period from 2017 to the
present. The corpus is mainly compiled from online news sources, and covers all major varieties of World
English.
