# Testing the Enhanced OED Upload System

## What Was Fixed
The OED parser now properly handles full content from PDF files by:
1. **Removing null characters** that break PostgreSQL storage
2. **Capturing up to 50,000 characters** (instead of being truncated at ~1,600)
3. **Using Claude LLM to clean content** - removes website boilerplate while preserving dictionary content
4. **Preserving ALL historical quotations** (now captures 13 quotations from 1663-1995 for ontology.pdf)

## What Gets Cleaned Out
The parser now automatically removes:
- Cookie policy and privacy notices
- Website navigation elements
- Copyright notices and URLs
- Statistical methodology explanations
- Browser interface elements

## What Gets Preserved
- Complete etymology with sources
- All pronunciations (British/US)
- All definitions and sub-definitions
- **Every historical quotation with date and full text**
- Related terms and compounds
- Usage notes and frequency data

## How to Test the Fix

### Option 1: Upload OED PDF Through Web Interface

1. Go to http://localhost:8080/references/upload
2. Click on the "OED Dictionary" tab
3. Upload the file: `app/docs/ontology.pdf`
4. The system will:
   - Parse the PDF automatically
   - Extract the full 9,215 characters of content
   - Populate all fields including historical quotations
5. Click "Save OED Entry"
6. View the complete reference with all content preserved

### Option 2: Manual Entry Test

1. Go to http://localhost:8080/references/upload
2. Click on the "OED Dictionary" tab
3. In the "Full Text" field, you can paste any long OED content
4. The system will now store the complete text without truncation

## Verifying Success

After uploading, check the reference view page:
- Should show cleaned content (~4,000 characters for ontology.pdf, without website junk)
- **13 historical quotations** from 1663 to 1995 should all be present:
  - 1663, 1721, 1776, 1832, 1855, 1865, 1888, 1909, 1938, 1950, 1955, 1983, 1995
- The "Full Content" section should be readable and properly formatted
- No cookie policies or website navigation text

## For Experiments

The fixed references can now be used in experiments for:
- **Temporal Evolution**: All dated quotations are preserved
- **Domain Comparison**: Complete etymology and definitions available

## Technical Details

- **Parser location**: `app/services/oed_parser.py`
- **Null character fix**: Line 74 - `text.replace('\x00', '')`
- **Storage limit**: Increased to 50,000 characters
- **Database**: Using PostgreSQL TEXT field (no practical limit)
